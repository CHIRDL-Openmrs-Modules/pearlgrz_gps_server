 If (hasSexualPartner3 = Yes) AND (sexualPartner3AnalSex = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (hasSexualPartner3 = Yes) AND (sexualPartner3AnalSex = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (hasSexualPartner3 = Yes) AND (sexualPartner3AnalSex = Yes) AND (frequency = "Two times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
 If (hasSexualPartner3 = Yes) AND (sexualPartner3AnalSex = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
 If (hasSexualPartner3 = Yes) AND (sexualPartner3AnalSex = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
conclude False;
