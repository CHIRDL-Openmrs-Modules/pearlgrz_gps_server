Logic:
If (mode = PRODUCE) then

If (playedSports = Yes) AND (frequency = True) AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
If (playedSports = Yes) AND (frequency = True) AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
conclude False;

endif

If (mode = CONSUME) then

If  NOT(Box1=NULL) AND NOT(Box2=NULL) then
 CALL storeObs With "Starting-time for the First time played sports", "Box1";
 CALL storeObs With "Ending-time for the First time played sports", "Box2";
