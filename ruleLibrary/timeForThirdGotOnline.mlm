Data:

Input1:=read {input1 from Parameters};
Input2:=read {input2 from Parameters};
Input1Value:=read {input1value from Parameters};
Input2Value:=read {input2value from Parameters};

If (mode = PRODUCE) then
 gotOnline := read Last {Got online} Where it Occurred Within Past 1 Days;
 frequency := read Last {Number of times getting online} where it Occurred Within Past 1 Days;

Logic:
If (mode = PRODUCE) then

 If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
 If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
conclude False;

endif

If (mode = CONSUME) then

If  (Input1=true) AND (Input2=true) then
 CALL storeObs With "Starting-time for the Third time getting online", "Input1Value";
 CALL storeObs With "Ending-time for the Third time getting online", "Input2Value";
