Logic:
If (mode = PRODUCE) then

 If (usedPrescriptionDrugsNotOwned = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (usedPrescriptionDrugsNotOwned = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
 If (usedPrescriptionDrugsNotOwned = Yes) AND (frequency = "Three times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
 If (usedPrescriptionDrugsNotOwned = Yes) AND (frequency = "Four or more times") AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
conclude False;

endif

If (mode = CONSUME) then

If  (Box1=true) AND (Box3=true) then
 CALL storeObs With "Starting-time for the Third taking prescription drugs not prescribed to patient", "Box2";
 CALL storeObs With "Ending-time for the Third taking prescription drugs not prescribed to patient", "Box4";
