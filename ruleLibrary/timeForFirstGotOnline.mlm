Box2:=read {input2value from Parameters};

If (mode = PRODUCE) then
 gotOnline := read Last {Got online} Where it Occurred Within Past 1 Days;

Logic:
If (mode = PRODUCE) then

If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = True) AND (answered1 = False) then conclude True;
If (gotOnline = Yes) AND (frequency = True) AND (answered2 = False) then conclude True;
conclude False;

endif

If (mode = CONSUME) then

If  NOT(Box1=NULL) AND NOT(Box2=NULL) then
 CALL storeObs With "Starting-time for the First time getting online", "Box1";
 CALL storeObs With "Ending-time for the First time getting online", "Box2";
